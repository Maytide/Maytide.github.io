I am an undergraduate Electrical Engineering student at McMaster University with an interest in statistical signal processing, computer vision/image processing, communications, optimization and discrete math. In my spare time I enjoy programming, learning Japanese and fooling around with drawing/photo editing software (though I can't say I'm any good at it).

You can view some of my projects [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.markdown %}), and my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C2J2Ox-5NXxqoJsrpqE7M1CDfd84Xp_L).
