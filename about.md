Pointless fun.

I am a 4th year Electrical Engineering student at McMaster University with an interest in coding. I like watching anime, travelling with friends and learning new programming frameworks in my spare time.

You can view some of my projects [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.markdown %}).

I also take online courses for fun sometimes. So far, I've completed Coursera: Machine Learning 1, Intro to Special Relativity and the first two courses in the Deep Learning specialization.
